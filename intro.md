## Introduction to HASE

HASE is a Hierarchical computer Architecture design and Simulation
Environment which allows for the rapid development and exploration of
computer architectures at multiple levels of abstraction, encompassing
both hardware and software.

Many complex systems of interacting components can be more easily
understood as pictures rather than as words, and in a computer
architecture the dynamic behaviour of systems is frequently of
interest.  Thus the user interface to HASE is via a graphical design
window and HASE allows users to view the results of simulation runs
though animation of the design window.
