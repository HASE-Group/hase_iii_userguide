## Introduction to HASE

HASE is a Hierarchical computer Architecture design and Simulation Environment which allows for the rapid development and exploration of computer architectures at multiple levels of abstraction, encompassing both hardware and software.

Many complex systems of interacting components can be more easily understood as pictures rather than as words, and in a computer architecture the dynamic behaviour of systems is frequently of interest.  Thus the user interface to HASE is via a graphical design window and HASE allows users to view the results of simulation runs though animation of the design window.

## HASE History

The ideas for HASE grew from a simulator built for an MC88000 system in 1989, written in occam and run on a Meiko Computing Surface at the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre.  However, HASE itself has been developed using object oriented simulation languages, the first prototype using DEMOS, the second Sim++ and the current version Hase++.

Hase++ is a discrete event simulation engine with a programming interface similar to that of Sim++, but implemented using C++ and threads.  It includes a set of library routines to provide for process oriented discrete event simulation and a run time system for multi-threading many entities in parallel and keeping track of simulation time.

The first production version of HASE was developed as part of the ALAMO projectsupported by the UK EPSRC under grant GR/J43295 and has since been further developed and used for EMIN Project (EPSRC Grant GR/K19716), the QCDOC Computer Simulation project (EPSRC grant GR/R27129) and the Storlite Project (EPSRC grant GR/S28153).

In addition to supporting research projects, HASE has been used to support numerous undergraduate and taught MSc student projects and several models have beenused for virtual laboratory practical exercises.
